# Accounting Feature Disable Requirements

## Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for adding a configuration option to disable the accounting/bookkeeping feature by default. The accounting system is currently fully implemented but always enabled. This feature will allow administrators to control whether the accounting functionality is available through a configuration setting.

## Requirements

### 1. As a system administrator, I want to be able to disable the accounting feature through configuration, so that I can control whether this functionality is available in my deployment.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.1. The system shall provide a configuration option to enable or disable the accounting feature.
1.2. The default value for the accounting feature shall be disabled (false).
1.3. When the accounting feature is disabled, all accounting-related commands shall be ignored.
1.4. When the accounting feature is disabled, no accounting database tables shall be accessed.
1.5. When the accounting feature is enabled, all existing accounting functionality shall work as before.

### 2. As a Telegram bot user, I want to receive clear feedback when accounting commands are disabled, so that I understand why my commands are not working.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
2.1. When a user sends an accounting command while the feature is disabled, the bot shall respond with a clear message indicating the feature is disabled.
2.2. The response message shall be localized in Chinese (the primary language of the bot).
2.3. The response message shall not expose internal system details, only that the feature is disabled.

### 3. As a developer, I want the accounting disable feature to be implemented without breaking existing functionality, so that I can safely deploy this change.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
3.1. All existing unit tests shall pass when the accounting feature is enabled.
3.2. When the accounting feature is disabled, no accounting-related unit tests shall fail (they should be skipped or pass gracefully).
3.3. The implementation shall not introduce performance overhead when the feature is disabled.
3.4. The implementation shall not affect other bot functionalities when the accounting feature is disabled.

### 4. As a system maintainer, I want the configuration option to be clearly documented, so that I can easily understand how to enable or disable the feature.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
4.1. The configuration option shall be documented in the Config.json file structure.
4.2. The configuration option shall have a clear name that indicates its purpose (e.g., EnableAccounting).
4.3. The configuration option shall be included in the Env.cs configuration loading system.
4.4. The default value shall be explicitly set to false (disabled) in the configuration model.
