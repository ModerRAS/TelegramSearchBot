# Active Context - EditLLMConfService State Machine Refactor

## Current Work
- Refactored EditLLMConfService state management into EditLLMConfStateMachine
- Implemented Stateless-based state machine for configuration flows
- Added dynamic LLMProvider enum value generation using reflection
- Fixed compilation errors from state machine migration
- Cleaned up old state management code in EditLLMConfService

## Key Technical Details
- State machine pattern for configuration flows
- Redis-based state persistence
- Stateless library integration
- Dynamic enum value generation using reflection
- Skip None enum value in provider selection
- Type-safe enum parsing with validation
- Clean separation of concerns between service and state machine

## Next Steps
- Test all state machine transitions
- Add more LLM providers as needed
- Monitor state machine performance in production
